# UI/UX

## 2.1 Feature Set 1

- **Landing Page Design**: Utilized a welcoming, visually balanced layout with 
a black and white theme that aligns with professional presentation platforms, 
enhancing the first impression.

- **Clear Navigation**: Included prominent, distinct **Login** and **Register** 
buttons with clear hover effects to encourage interaction and guide users 
intuitively.

- **Consistent Layout and Design**: Ensured uniform styling (color scheme, 
font sizes, and button styling) across **Login**, **Register**, and **Landing** 
pages for visual continuity.

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Avoided unnecessary elements to keep the interface 
clean and focused, improving ease of use and visual appeal.
- **Error Handling and Feedback**: Provided clear feedback for form validation 
errors, both inline for missing fields and in a popup for API errors, enhancing 
user clarity.

- **Hover Effects for Interactive Elements**: Applied hover effects to buttons.
This provides a responsive feedback loop, enhancing usability 
by indicating which elements are interactive.

- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Enabled **Enter key** submission and **Arrow key** 
navigation across input fields, supporting a smoother interaction flow for 
keyboard users.

## 2.2 Feature Set 2

- **Visual Hierarchy and Feedback**:  uIsed a consistent color scheme and hover
 effects on buttons to guide users intuitively. Key actions like "New Slide" and
  "Delete Presentation" have distinct colors, making them easy to locate. 
  Hover effects give users responsive feedback, indicating which elements are 
  interactive and improving navigation.

- **Navbar Highlights and Logout**: The navigation bar highlights the current 
page with an underline, providing users with a clear indication of their current
 location within the app. Additionally, the logout button is distinct, ensuring 
 users can easily log out when needed, which enhances usability and ensures 
 smooth user flow.

- **Grid Layout for Presentations**: The dashboard organizes presentations in a
 responsive grid layout, ensuring a visually clean and organized view across 
 all devices. By displaying the most recent presentations at the top, users can 
 quickly access their latest work, enhancing usability and convenience.

 - **Modal Usability**: Modals for creating new presentations and editing 
 thumbnails have been designed to focus on clarity and ease of use. 
 By separating thumbnail options (URL or file upload) with toggle buttons, 
 users have a clear choice, with each option providing real-time feedback or 
 previews.

- **Icon-Based Buttons**: Each major button includes an icon paired with 
descriptive text, such as the pencil icon for "Edit" and trash icon for 
"Delete Presentation." This combination aids in quick recognition, especially 
for users who rely on visual cues to understand button functions.

- **Slide Navigation with Icons**: Arrow icons are used for slide navigation, 
and they change appearance when disabled, providing a visual cue about the 
user's position within the slideshow. This approach reduces confusion and makes 
navigation between slides intuitive.

## 2.3 Feature Set 3

- **Enhanced Numerical Input Control**: For fields that require numerical input,
 such as element size and position, inputs are constrained to values between 1 
 and 100. This restriction ensures that elements are added with accurate and 
 proportional dimensions relative to the slide, preventing layout 
 inconsistencies and enhancing usability.

- **Dynamic Color Selection for Text**: The color input in text modals includes 
a color picker to provide users with an intuitive selection interface, rather 
than requiring manual HEX code entry. This feature simplifies customization and 
improves the overall editing experience.

- **Real-Time Image Preview**: When uploading an image, users are shown a 
real-time preview of the selected image, ensuring they can verify their 
selection before adding it to the slide.

- **Consistent Icon-Based Action Buttons**: Toolbar buttons for adding text, 
image, video, and code blocks are accompanied by distinct icons that align with 
each element type. This icon-based design aids in quick recognition, making the 
interface more visually informative and user-friendly.

- **Responsive Toolbar**: The toolbar was designed to be fully responsive, 
adapting its layout based on the screen size. On larger screens, 
the toolbar appears vertically on the left side, shifting the slides 
to the right to accommodate it while maintaining a balanced layout. 
On smaller screens, the toolbar switches to a horizontal layout at the top, 
ensuring that the slide remains centered and maximized for editing. This dynamic
adjustment enhances usability across devices and screen sizes, providing an 
optimized experience for both desktop and mobile users.

## 2.4 Feature Set 4

- **Enhanced Font Selection Experience**: The font-family dropdown in the 
**AddTextModal** and **EditTextModal** allows users to choose between multiple 
font styles with a real-time visual preview. This feature provides a clear sense
 of customization, improving the text editing experience beyond the basic 
 requirements.

- **Interactive Background Selection**: Designed a modal for choosing 
background styles (solid, gradient, or image) that provides real-time 
visual previews of the selected background. The inclusion of gradient 
direction controls (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom) and a toggle to
 edit either the current or default background settings enhances user control 
 and decision-making.
