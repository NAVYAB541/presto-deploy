## 2.2 Feature Set 2

- **Visual Hierarchy and Feedback**:  uIsed a consistent color scheme and hover
 effects on buttons to guide users intuitively. Key actions like "New Slide" and
  "Delete Presentation" have distinct colors, making them easy to locate. 
  Hover effects give users responsive feedback, indicating which elements are 
  interactive and improving navigation.

- **Navbar Highlights and Logout**: The navigation bar highlights the current 
page with an underline, providing users with a clear indication of their current
 location within the app. Additionally, the logout button is distinct, ensuring 
 users can easily log out when needed, which enhances usability and ensures 
 smooth user flow.

- **Grid Layout for Presentations**: The dashboard organizes presentations in a
 responsive grid layout, ensuring a visually clean and organized view across 
 all devices. By displaying the most recent presentations at the top, users can 
 quickly access their latest work, enhancing usability and convenience.

 - **Modal Usability**: Modals for creating new presentations and editing 
 thumbnails have been designed to focus on clarity and ease of use. 
 By separating thumbnail options (URL or file upload) with toggle buttons, 
 users have a clear choice, with each option providing real-time feedback or 
 previews.

- **Icon-Based Buttons**: Each major button includes an icon paired with 
descriptive text, such as the pencil icon for "Edit" and trash icon for 
"Delete Presentation." This combination aids in quick recognition, especially 
for users who rely on visual cues to understand button functions.

- **Slide Navigation with Icons**: Arrow icons are used for slide navigation, 
and they change appearance when disabled, providing a visual cue about the 
user's position within the slideshow. This approach reduces confusion and makes 
navigation between slides intuitive.
