# A11Y Accessibility

## 2.1 Feature Set 1

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enabled **Arrow key** navigation for users to move 
between input fields on the **Login** and **Register** pages, improving keyboard 
accessibility.

- **Enter Key Submission**: Enabled **Enter key** functionality for form 
submission, allowing users to submit the form without a mouse click.

- **Focus Indicators**: Used focus styles to indicate active input fields, 
ensuring users can visually track their position within the form.

- **Accessible Error Feedback**: Displayed inline error messages in red text 
below each field and provided a distinct **Error Popup** with a red background 
for API errors, enhancing readability and making errors accessible.

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate HTML elements (`<label>`, `<input>`, 
`<button>`) with explicit associations between labels and inputs, aiding screen 
reader interpretation.

- **Clear Call-to-Actions**: Provided meaningful link labels like 
"Register here" and "Return to the Landing page" for better context and 
navigation.

## 2.2 Feature Set 2

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enabled **Arrow key** functionality for navigating 
between slides within the presentation editor, enhancing accessibility for 
keyboard users. The new Presentation modal also provides the users with the
ability to navigate between input fields using up or down arrow.

- **Modals**: Ensured that modals trap focus, requiring users to 
complete the interaction before returning to the main dashboard or editor, 
improving keyboard navigation.

- **Error Handling**: An error popup displays clear feedback if a user 
attempts to delete the only slide in a presentation. This ensures that users 
understand the restriction and prevents unintentional actions. The popup includes a dismiss button, allowing users to acknowledge and continue working without being redirected elsewhere.

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate semantic elements like `<button>` for 
interactive elements, ensuring screen readers can interpret them correctly.

- **Accessible Thumbnails**: Provided both URL and file upload options for 
thumbnail updates with real-time previews, allowing users to confirm their 
selection before applying changes.

- **Clear Visual Indicators**: Used icons in buttons, such as the trash icon 
for "Delete Presentation" and pencil icon for "Edit Title," which enhance 
recognition of actions for both visual and screen reader users.

## 2.3 Feature Set 3

- **Keyboard-Only Numerical Adjustments**: For size and position input fields in
 modals, users can adjust values through keyboard controls, providing accessible
  and precise adjustments. The fields are limited to values between 1 and 100, 
  ensuring inputs remain within intended bounds, which enhances accessibility 
  and usability for keyboard users.

- **Clear Focus Management in Modals**: Each modal traps focus within its 
content, ensuring that users can navigate through inputs without losing focus 
or accessing elements outside the modal.

- **Real-Time Error Prevention**: By limiting the range of values in size and 
position inputs, users are prevented from entering out-of-bounds values, which 
can reduce errors and streamline the editing process for users relying on screen 
readers or keyboards.

- **Accessible Color Picker for Text**: The color picker in the text modals is 
accessible to screen readers, allowing visually impaired users to select and 
confirm text color changes effectively. This addition supports an inclusive 
design by offering more accessible color selection options
